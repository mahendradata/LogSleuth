def analyze_log_fields(fields, rules):
    """
    Analyze selected fields in a parsed log entry against a list of detection rules.

    This function inspects specific fields from a decoded NGINX log entry (currently only the 'url'),
    and attempts to match them against precompiled regular expressions defined in the rules list.

    Args:
        fields (dict): A dictionary of log fields, typically returned by `decode_log_line()`.
                       Expected to include at least the 'url' key.
        rules (list): A list of rule dictionaries. Each rule must contain:
                      - 'id': A unique identifier for the rule.
                      - 'compiled': A precompiled regular expression object (via `re.compile()`).

    Returns:
        str or None: The `id` of the first rule that matches the inspected field, or `None` if no match is found.
