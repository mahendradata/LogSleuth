def analyze_log_fields(fields, rules):
    """
    Analyze specified fields in a parsed log entry against a list of detection rules.

    This function evaluates selected fields from a decoded NGINX log entry—currently limited to the 'url' field—
    and checks for matches against a list of detection rules represented as precompiled regular expressions.

    Args:
        fields (dict): A dictionary of log fields, typically produced by `decode_log_line()`.
                       Must include at least the 'url' key.
        rules (list): A list of rule dictionaries. Each dictionary must contain:
                      - 'id' (str): A unique identifier for the rule.
                      - 'compiled' (Pattern): A precompiled regular expression object (`re.Pattern`).

    Returns:
        str or None: The ID of the first matching rule, or `None` if no matches are found.
